# Authentication

A client signs a member in with the **OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant** (RFC 8628), binds
every token to a key of its own with **DPoP** (RFC 9449, ES256), and sends every call with
`Authorization: DPoP <token>` and a fresh `DPoP` proof. This page describes each step exactly as
the gateway and the identity provider check it. The
[client security requirements](client-security.md) say how tokens and keys are kept; a
[reference implementation](dpop-reference/README.md) builds the proofs.

Take the endpoints from the discovery document, and use it only when its `issuer` is exactly the
pinned value. Another issuer — the local sandbox — may be chosen only through a developer
environment variable, never in the user interface ([client security](client-security.md)).

## Scopes

Request, space-separated:

- **`exchange.connect`** — always. It admits the service document, the installation label and the
  account check, and every exchange scope gives the token the gateway's audience; a token without
  one is refused `UNAUTHENTICATED`.
- **The capability scopes of the features the member enabled**, and no others — see
  [capabilities](README.md#capabilities). A capability the member turns on later needs a new device
  login with the larger set.
- **`offline_access`** — always. A device login joins the member's browser session; without an
  offline session, signing out of the Basetool in the browser would end the connection too. And
  after the member disconnected the client, a token without `offline_access` counts from the
  browser session's sign-in, which a device login that joins it does not renew: it stays
  `CLIENT_REVOKED` until the member signs in again.

Do not request `openid`, `profile` or `email`: the client receives no personal data. The token
response's `scope` lists what was granted. A route passes only when its scope is in the token
**and** the Basetool's registry grants it to your client; anything else is `403 SCOPE_MISSING`.

## Signing in

### 1. Open the installation's key

Load the DPoP key of this installation, or create it on first use (see
[installation identity](#installation-identity)). Every request below that carries a proof uses
this one key.

### 2. Ask for a device code

The device authorization request carries no proof; nothing is issued there.

```http
POST /auth/realms/iri/protocol/openid-connect/auth/device HTTP/1.1
Host: profit-base.online
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=example-client&scope=exchange.connect%20exchange.blueprints.read%20offline_access
```

The answer holds `device_code`, `user_code`, `verification_uri`, `verification_uri_complete`,
`expires_in` (600 s) and `interval` (5 s).

### 3. Let the member approve

Show the `user_code` and the bare `verification_uri`, and open that address in the member's browser
or let the member open it. The member signs in to the Basetool, or already is, **types the code**
your application shows, and sees the consent page, in German, with one line per requested
capability. The consent page appears on **every** device login, also when the member consented
before.

Do not open, show or send `verification_uri_complete`. A link that already carries the code skips
the page where the member types it — and with it the Basetool's warning — and it teaches members to
follow code links, which is exactly what an attacker sends them.

Only ever show a code this installation created itself, and never relay a code to or from another
device: a device code typed into someone else's browser hands over that person's account (RFC 8628
§5.4). The Basetool's code-entry page warns the member about it, and the consent page repeats the
warning with the code of this sign-in, which must match the one your application shows. Every new
connection is announced to the member and stays marked "New" on the member's *Connected
applications* page in the Basetool until the member acknowledges it.

### 4. Poll the token endpoint

Poll every `interval` seconds, each time with a **new** proof (`htm` `POST`, `htu` the token
endpoint, no `ath`):

```http
POST /auth/realms/iri/protocol/openid-connect/token HTTP/1.1
Host: profit-base.online
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
DPoP: eyJ0eXAiOiJkcG9wK2p3dCIsImFsZyI6IkVTMjU2IiwiandrIjp7Imt0eSI6IkVDIiwi...

grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Adevice_code&device_code=...&client_id=example-client
```

| Answer | Meaning | Next |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `400 authorization_pending` | The member has not decided yet. | Poll again after `interval`. |
| `400 slow_down` | Polling too fast. | Add 5 s to the interval for good. |
| `400 access_denied` | The member declined. | Stop; ask again only when the member starts it. |
| `400 expired_token` | The 600 s passed. | Start over at step 2. |
| `200` | Approved. | Continue with step 5. |

### 5. Keep the tokens

The answer carries `access_token`, `token_type`, `expires_in`, `refresh_token` and `scope`.
**`token_type` must be `DPoP`**; refuse any other answer, because an unbound token cannot use the
exchange. Both tokens are bound to your key (`cnf.jkt`). Store the refresh token in the platform's
secret store, never anywhere else ([client security](client-security.md)).

### 6. Label the installation

Call `POST /exchange/v1/me/installation` with a label the member chose, so they can tell two devices
apart and disconnect one of them.

## DPoP proofs

### The key

One **P-256** key per installation, created once and kept. Its private half never leaves the
platform's key store where the platform allows that — a non-exportable CNG key on Windows, in the
TPM where there is one. The refresh token is bound to it: a refresh with another key is refused, so
losing the key ends the connection.

### Building a proof

A proof is a JWS signed with the installation's key. Build a **new one for every request**, every
poll and every retry.

Header:

| Member | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `typ` | `dpop+jwt` |
| `alg` | `ES256` |
| `jwk` | the **public** key only: `kty` `EC`, `crv` `P-256`, `x`, `y` — never `d` |

Claims:

| Claim | Value | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jti` | a unique random id, at least 96 bits; never reused — the gateway refuses a replayed one | always |
| `htm` | the request's method, such as `GET` or `POST` | always |
| `htu` | the request URL without query and fragment — see below | always |
| `iat` | the current time in whole seconds since the epoch | always |
| `ath` | base64url, without padding, of the SHA-256 of the access token's ASCII bytes | every API call |
| `nonce` | the server's latest `DPoP-Nonce` | every API call; at the token endpoint when Keycloak asks |

The signature is ECDSA P-256 over SHA-256 of `base64url(header) "." base64url(claims)`, in the JWS
form: `r` and `s` as two 32-byte big-endian halves, 64 bytes in all — **not** DER, which most
crypto libraries return and which has to be converted.

### `htu`

The gateway compares `htu` with `https://ingest.profit-base.online` followed by the request's path,
**as a plain string**. Write it the same way:

- scheme and host in lower case, no port;
- the path exactly as sent — the same percent-encoding, the same trailing slash;
- no query string and no fragment.

A request to `https://ingest.profit-base.online/exchange/v1/me/blueprints?cursor=f1.7.42` carries
the `htu` `https://ingest.profit-base.online/exchange/v1/me/blueprints`. At the token endpoint
`htu` is the token endpoint's URL.

### `iat` and clock skew

The gateway accepts an `iat` up to **30 seconds** before or after its own time. Keycloak is
stricter: from about 25 seconds before to 15 seconds after, and it checks the proof before the
grant, so a desktop clock that runs 15 seconds fast fails the sign-in itself. Measure each server's
offset from the `Date` header of its answers and correct `iat` per server. Retry a proof refused for
its time once with the corrected clock; if that fails too, ask the member to synchronise the clock.

### The server nonce

Every exchange call needs the gateway's **server nonce** (RFC 9449 §8).

- Every answer of an exchange route carries `DPoP-Nonce`, refusals included, except those the
  gateway gives before it reads the token: the per-IP `429 RATE_LIMITED`, `413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`,
  the `503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` when the identity provider cannot be reached, and a refused method,
  path or query. The anonymous schema and OpenAPI reads carry none either. Keep the latest nonce per
  server, put it into the next proof, and keep it when an answer carries none.
- A proof without a current nonce is answered `401` with the code `DPOP_INVALID`,
  `WWW-Authenticate: DPoP algs="…", error="use_dpop_nonce"` and a fresh `DPoP-Nonce`. **Retry once**
  with a new proof carrying that nonce; a write keeps its `Idempotency-Key`.
- The nonce challenge comes before every claim check: `htm`, `htu`, `iat`, the key binding, `ath`
  and the `jti` replay. A proof whose claims are also wrong gets the challenge first and
  `DPOP_INVALID` with `error="invalid_dpop_proof"` on the retry — do not retry again. A proof that
  cannot be parsed or verified at all — a wrong `typ`, an unsupported `alg`, a missing or private
  `jwk`, a bad signature — is refused `invalid_dpop_proof` at once, without a challenge.
- A nonce holds five to ten minutes; a restart of the gateway invalidates every nonce, which costs
  one retry.
- Nonces belong to one server. Never send the gateway's nonce to Keycloak. Keycloak issues none
  today; if it answers `400` with the error `use_dpop_nonce` and a `DPoP-Nonce`, retry once the same
  way.

### Live proofs per member

The gateway remembers every accepted proof's `jti` to refuse a replay, and it holds at most **600**
live proofs per member, over all of the member's clients and installations together, and 100 000 in
all. A proof counts from its acceptance until just after 30 seconds past its `iat`. A proof refused
for its nonce takes no room, and neither does a proof refused for either cap; proofs sent to
Keycloak do not count.

A client that keeps to the [rate limits](sync-guide.md#rate-limits-quota-and-back-off) stays far
below the cap: 120 requests a minute hold about 60 live proofs. The cap is reached only when the
member's clients together send far more.

A proof over the member's cap is refused with `429` and the code `DPOP_PROOF_LIMIT`, a fresh
`DPoP-Nonce` and `Retry-After`: the whole seconds, rounded up and at least 1, until the member's
earliest live proof no longer counts. Wait at least that long, retry with a new proof, and send the
member's requests more slowly — the [back-off](sync-guide.md#rate-limits-quota-and-back-off)
applies.

When all members together hold the 100 000, the gateway is overloaded, and its maintainers are
alerted. A proof is then refused with `503` and the code `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, a fresh `DPoP-Nonce`
and `Retry-After`: the whole seconds, rounded up and at least 1, until the gateway's earliest live
proof no longer counts. It is not the member's fault: wait at least `Retry-After`, then retry with a
new proof, backing off as for any other `503`.

### Calling the API

```http
GET /exchange/v1/me/blueprints HTTP/1.1
Host: ingest.profit-base.online
Authorization: DPoP eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCIgOiAiSldUIiwia2lkIiA6ICJ...
DPoP: eyJ0eXAiOiJkcG9wK2p3dCIsImFsZyI6IkVTMjU2IiwiandrIjp7Imt0eSI6IkVDIiwi...
User-Agent: ExampleClient/1.2.0 (+https://example.org/client)
```

Send exactly one `Authorization` and one `DPoP` header. The `Bearer` scheme, a `DPoP`-scheme
request without a `DPoP` header and a token that is not DPoP-bound are refused `401 DPOP_REQUIRED`.

## Refreshing

The access token lives 300 seconds. Refresh shortly before `expires_in` runs out, or once after an
`UNAUTHENTICATED`:

```http
POST /auth/realms/iri/protocol/openid-connect/token HTTP/1.1
Host: profit-base.online
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
DPoP: eyJ0eXAiOiJkcG9wK2p3dCIsImFsZyI6IkVTMjU2IiwiandrIjp7Imt0eSI6IkVDIiwi...

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=...&client_id=example-client
```

The proof comes from the same key, without `ath`. When the answer carries a `refresh_token`, store
it in place of the old one.

- `400 invalid_grant` means the connection is over: the member disconnected the client, left the
  organisation, did not use it for 30 days, or reached the 90-day limit. Delete the stored refresh
  token and start a new device login only when the member asks for it.
- A refused proof — `400` with `invalid_dpop_proof` or `invalid_request` — says nothing about the
  refresh token. Keep the credential, fix the proof or the clock, and retry once.

## Disconnecting

"Disconnect" in the client does three things, in this order:

1. Revoke the refresh token (RFC 7009) at the revocation endpoint with `token`,
   `token_type_hint=refresh_token` and `client_id`, and a proof like at the token endpoint —
   Keycloak ignores the proof today, a stricter policy would require it.
2. Delete the stored refresh token.
3. Delete the DPoP key. A later connection creates a new key and so a new installation.

The revocation is best effort: delete locally whatever it answers.

The member can also disconnect in the Basetool, under *Connected applications*: one installation,
or the whole client. The client learns it from the next call — `INSTALLATION_REVOKED` or
`CLIENT_REVOKED` — or from `invalid_grant` on the next refresh.

## Installation identity

An installation is one client on one PC. It is identified by the **RFC 7638 thumbprint of its DPoP
key**, which the token carries as `cnf.jkt`; the gateway takes the installation from the key, not
from anything the client says.

- The Basetool gives each installation an opaque `installationId` — never the thumbprint — in the
  installation response and the service document. A tombstone's `removedBy.installationId` names
  the installation that removed an entry, so a client recognises its own removals.
- **Keep the key.** A new key is a new installation: the member is notified of a new connection,
  and an unusual number of them alerts the Basetool's maintainers. Never create a key per session
  or per launch.
- A disconnected installation's key is refused for good (`INSTALLATION_REVOKED`), also with tokens
  issued afterwards. Delete the key and the tokens; reconnecting needs a new key.

## Errors

The gateway checks a request in this order: its method, path and query, the per-IP limit and the
body's size, the token and the proof, the token's audience, the route, the exchange switch and the
registry, the installation's key, the client revocation, the route's scope, the minimum version, the
limits and the quota, the `Idempotency-Key`, the body; then the Basetool checks the member and
repeats the switch, registry, revocation and scope checks. The gateway reads the registry through a
cache of up to five seconds, so right after a change the Basetool may be the side that refuses; it
answers with the same code and status as the gateway would. Every refusal is an RFC 9457 problem
with a `code` from the [error registry](errors.md).

| Code | HTTP | When | Client action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `UNAUTHENTICATED` | 401 | No token; a token that is invalid, expired, or not issued for the gateway | Refresh once and retry; after `invalid_grant` start a device login when the member asks. Do not loop when the refreshed token is refused too. |
| `DPOP_REQUIRED` | 401 | The `Bearer` scheme, a `DPoP`-scheme request without a `DPoP` header, or a token that is not DPoP-bound | Send `Authorization: DPoP` with a proof; request the token with a DPoP proof so it is bound. |
| `DPOP_INVALID` with `use_dpop_nonce` | 401 | The proof lacks the current server nonce | Retry once with a new proof carrying the `DPoP-Nonce` of the answer. |
| `DPOP_INVALID` with `invalid_dpop_proof` | 401 | The proof is malformed, signed by another key than `cnf.jkt`, replayed, outside the `iat` window, for another method or URL, or has the wrong `ath` | Fix the proof; correct the clock once; do not loop. |
| `DPOP_PROOF_LIMIT` | 429 | The member already holds its cap of [live proofs](#live-proofs-per-member) | Wait at least `Retry-After`, retry with a new proof, and slow down. |
| `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | All members together hold the gateway's cap of [live proofs](#live-proofs-per-member), or the identity provider cannot be reached | Wait at least `Retry-After`, then retry with a new proof. |
| `SCOPE_MISSING` | 403 | The route's capability is not in the token, or not granted to the client | Start a device login with the scope, if the member wants the feature. |
| `CLIENT_REVOKED` | 401 | The member disconnected the client after this connection was made | Discard the tokens; start a device login only when the member asks. |
| `INSTALLATION_REVOKED` | 401 | The member disconnected this installation | Discard the tokens **and** the key; reconnecting needs a new key. |
| `CLIENT_NOT_ALLOWED` | 403 | The client is not in the registry | Stop; the client is not approved. |
| `CLIENT_SUSPENDED` | 403 | The client is suspended | Stop and tell the member; try again at the next start or when the member asks, never on a timer. |
| `CLIENT_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED` | 403 | The `User-Agent` version is below the client's minimum | Ask the member to update. |
| `TERMS_NOT_ACCEPTED` | 403 | The member has not accepted the current terms | Ask the member to open the Basetool and accept them. |
| `PENDING_APPROVAL` | 403 | The member's registration awaits approval | Stop; nothing to sync yet. |
| `NO_ROLE` | 403 | The member holds no role | Stop and tell the member. |
| `ACTING_MEMBER_REFUSED` | 403 | The member is unknown, disabled or deleted | Stop and tell the member. |
| `NOT_PERMITTED` | 403 | The member may not do this | Stop; do not retry. |

At the token endpoint Keycloak answers with OAuth errors, not problem documents:

| Error | When | Client action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authorization_pending`, `slow_down` | While polling | See [step 4](#4-poll-the-token-endpoint). |
| `access_denied` | The member declined | Stop. |
| `expired_token` | The device code expired | Start a new device login. |
| `invalid_grant` | The refresh token is no longer valid | Delete it; start a device login when the member asks. |
| `invalid_dpop_proof`, `invalid_request` | The proof was refused, often for its `iat` | Keep the credential; fix the proof or the clock and retry once. |
| `use_dpop_nonce` | The server wants a nonce | Retry once with the `DPoP-Nonce` of the answer. |

## Reference implementation

[`dpop-reference/`](dpop-reference/README.md) is a small, MIT-licensed Python package with no
dependency beyond the standard library. It keeps the key in Windows CNG or, on Linux, in an OpenSSL
key file with mode `0600`; computes the JWK thumbprint; signs ES256 in the JWS form; builds proofs
with `jti`, `htm`, `htu`, `iat`, `ath` and `nonce`; normalises `htu`; and remembers each server's
nonce. Its tests run offline with `python -m unittest`.
